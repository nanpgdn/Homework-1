In this assignment, I cleaned up the html and css by consolidating and simplifying redundant code.

## Changes

I added alt tags to the images to add to accessibility.
There were too many unnecessary css attributes, so I took the redundant attributes and consolidated them down.
I renamed some of the elements in the html so that the names and meanings were clearer(i.e. changiing 'div' to header, section, and aside)


## The following is a png of the css with changes and notes.
